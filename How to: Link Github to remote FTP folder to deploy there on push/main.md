The source of this tutorial is: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ftp-deploy?version=4.3.0

## Step 1: Create new Github repository
**Note**: You may want to make the repository private
Create a `README.md` file at the start, as it will be anoying to manually add files afterhand if you don't

## Step 2: Link it locally and create the `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` files
Follow the instructions [here](/How%20to:%20Create%20new%20typescript%20project%20in%20VS2019%20remotely%20connected%20to%20github/main.md#how-to-create-new-typescript-project-in-vs2019-remotely-connected-to-github)
If the project is going to use typescript, then create the `tsconfig.json` file. Note you must then restart visual studio for the `tsconfig.json` to take effect

## Step 3: Setup action in the repository
* Go in the `Actions` tab of the repo:
